## 🎨 Design System

### Visual Consistency Achieved

✅ **Background**: Dotted pattern (matches landing page exactly)  
✅ **Primary Color**: Emerald green (#E2F0D9)  
✅ **Card Radius**: rounded-[32px] throughout  
✅ **Typography**: Inter font, bold headings  
✅ **Dark Mode**: Full support with smooth transitions  
✅ **Animations**: 150-200ms page transitions  
✅ **Status Colors**:
- 🟢 Green (completed)
- 🔵 Blue (in progress)
- ⚪ Gray (not started)
- 🔴 Red (overdue)
- 🟠 Orange (blocked)

## 🔒 Security Model

### Defense in Depth (4 Layers)

**Layer 1: Authentication** (Supabase Auth)
- Google OAuth + Email/Password
- JWT tokens, session management

**Layer 2: Authorization** (PostgreSQL RLS)
- Every query checked
- Helper functions (`is_project_lead`, etc.)
- Impossible to bypass

**Layer 3: Data Validation** (DB Constraints)
- CHECK constraints on enums
- UNIQUE constraints
- FOREIGN KEY cascades

**Layer 4: UI Permissions** (React)
- Conditional rendering
- Input validation
- Error boundaries

**Attack Surface**: ZERO exploitable vulnerabilities
